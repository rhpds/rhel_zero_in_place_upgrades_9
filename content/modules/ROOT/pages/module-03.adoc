You saw in the last step how Leapp produced an error in order to prevent
a broken upgrade. In order to fix this issue, you will need to disable
this feature in the sshd configuration file:

[source,bash,run]
----
sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----

There are other risks that were identified. If you are curious what else
LEAPP found, take a closer look at the log file mentioned in the
previous step:

[source,bash,run]
----
cat /var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt
----

Re-run the preupgrade check to verify the change satisfied the result

[source,bash,run]
----
leapp preupgrade --target 9.4
----

Now, you are ready to run the actual upgrade.
