You saw in the last step how Leapp produced an error in order to prevent
a broken upgrade. There are other risks that were identified. If you are
curious what else LEAPP found, take a closer look at the log file
mentioned in the previous step:

....
cat /var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt
....

Re-run the preupgrade check to verify the change satisfied the result

....
leapp preupgrade --target 9.2
....

[source,bash]
----
# leapp preupgrade --target 9.2
