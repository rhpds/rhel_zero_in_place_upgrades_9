== Running the upgrade

Now that you have verified the RHEL system meets all the expected
conditions, it is time to kick off the upgrade process: (Note: This
process will take awhile.)

[source,bash,run]
----
leapp upgrade --target 9.4
----

____
[!IMPORTANT] The Leapp process can take upwards of 15 minutes to run.
____

If you would like to proceed with the lab without waiting for the
upgrade to complete, click on the `Upgraded RHEL` tab and continue in
that terminal. You can skip the reboot step below. Proceed to the step
`Verifying the upgrade` below.

A reboot is required for the RHEL 9-based initial RAM disk image
(initramfs), upgrades all packages and automatically reboots to the RHEL
9 system.

____
[!NOTE] You can combine these two steps with the –reboot option
`leapp upgrade --target 9.4 --reboot`
____

[source,bash,run]
----
reboot
----

Now, leapp is performing several actions inside a temporary environment.
This includes creating a new initramfs image, relabeling SELinux
contexts, and well as cleaning up any remaining RHEL 8 packages. The
reboot process can take up to 15 minutes.

The `Optional step` below shows how you can view the reboot/upgrade
process.

== Verifying Reboot (Optional)

This step is optional but it may provide insight into the upgrade
process. This lab provides a web console UI to the virtual machine host.
You can log into the web UI to view the upgrade process after `reboot`
has been executed.

Click on `RHEL Web Console`to log into the web UI.

.web console tab

Use the following credentials to log into the web console.

Username

....
rhel
....

Password

....
redhat
....

.web ui login

Next, give yourself administrative access by clicking on the button
`Turn on administrative access` and entering the password `redhat`
again.

.admin

Navigate to `Virtual machines`

.vms

Click on `rhel08` image:../assets/rhel07.png[rhel07]

Select the `Serial Console`.

You can now view the upgrade process in the console window.

.console

Please continue to `Verifying the upgrade` below.

== Verifying the upgrade

Once the new initramfs image is in place, package updates run, and
SELinux relabel completion, the system will perform one final reboot.

Refresh the Instruqt console to log back into your host, by clicking the
button shown below.

.console
image::refreshbutton.png[console]

Once that is done, you will be logged into the system’s terminal once
more. Finally, we will verify the update was successful by looking at
the release file we referenced earlier in the lab:

[source,bash,run]
----
cat /etc/redhat-release
----

Note that we are now running the latest version of RHEL 9!

OPTIONAL: You may also review the log file if you so choose. The full
output is available at /var/log/leapp/leapp-upgrade.log

[source,bash,run]
----
sudo less /var/log/leapp/leapp-upgrade.log
----

There are other methods for upgrading to the latest version of RHEL
using the leapp tooling including the Web Console and Satellite. For
those operations, refer to the documentation on Red Hat’s website.
