== Running the pre-upgrade assistant and resolving issues

Built into the leapp tool is a utility that collects data about the
system, assesses upgradability, and generates a pre-upgrade report. On
your lab system, perform the pre-upgrade test: (This process will take a
couple minutes.)

....
leapp preupgrade --target 9.2
....

[source,bash]
----
# leapp preupgrade --target 9.2
==> Processing phase `configuration_phase`
====> * ipu_workflow_config
        IPU workflow config actor
==> Processing phase `FactsCollection`
====> * scan_grub_device_name
        Find the name of the block device where GRUB is located
====> * system_facts
        Provides data about many facts from system.

Notice how the upgrade was "`inhibited`" because the preupgrade
assistant requires your input on one or more issues before it will
safely proceed. Take a look at the first entry in the `+leapp-report+`
file in the log directory:

....
head -n 5 /var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt
....

[source,bash]
----
# head -n 5 /var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt
Risk Factor: high (inhibitor)
Title: Possible problems with remote login using root account
Summary: OpenSSH configuration file will get updated to RHEL9 version, no longer allowing root login with password. It is a good practice to use non-root administrative user and non-password authentications, but if you rely on the remote root login, this change can lock you out of this system.
Remediation: [hint] If you depend on remote root logins using passwords, consider setting up a different user for remote administration or adding a comment into the sshd_config next to the "PermitRootLogin yes" directive to prevent rpm replacing it during the upgrade.

One of the major security changes in RHEL 9 was that the `+root+`
account is no longer allowed to login via SSH by default. In order to
fix this issue prior to the upgrade, you will need to disable this
feature in the sshd configuration file:

....
sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
....

[source,bash]
----
# sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
